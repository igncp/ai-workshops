# AI Workshops

A repo to save my different AI learnings with this alien technology.

Specially interested in:

- Open Source technology which allows running AI models locally
- Infrastructure to run AI models at scale, potentially using Nix for the reproducibility
- Prompt engineering techniques for better results
- Fine-tuning and customizing AI models for specific tasks
- Integrations of AI models into applications and workflows with enough guardrails
