- The most important feature of embeddings is their geometric relationship: distance equals meaning
- In Node.js, embeddings are `Float32Array`
- Pooling in embeddings is the process of condensing a sequence of token-level embeddings (like words in a sentence) into a single, fixed-length vector that represents the whole sequence's meaning
    - There are different ways, like `average`, `max`, etc.
- Cosine similarity is typically preferred for text embeddings, where a higher score indicates greater similarity (a value of 1 means identical, 0 means orthogonal, -1 means opposite)
- `@xenova/transformers` for the cosine similarity didn't work in Mac M2, probably due to the GPU (c++ error due to hardware)
- `dtype` means Data Type and `fp32` means single-precision floating point, which uses 32 bits of memory to store each number.
