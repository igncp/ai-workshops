- Trim the song:
- `ffmpeg -ss 00:00:00 -t 00:01:00 -i input.mp3 -acodec copy output.mp3`
- Regarding the error when running in Mac Mini
  - FP16 (half-precision) is generally not supported or efficient on CPUs because most lack native hardware support (ALU) for 16-bit floating-point arithmetic, forcing slow emulation. While modern CPUs may have ISA extensions (like AVX512-FP16 or AMX), standard CPU libraries often lack optimized kernels for FP16, resulting in slower performance than FP32.
